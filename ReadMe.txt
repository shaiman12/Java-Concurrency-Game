Run the program by using the following java command line prompt:
java WordApp <total words> <words on screen> <dictionary file>

It is reccomended to run the program through an IDE such as eclipse for 
efficient compilation of classes. Alternatively you can use the Makefile.

The java files are not seperated by bin and source directories in order to make the Makefiles 
less complex.

For further information about how the classes work please refer to the javadocs documentation for more precise information
